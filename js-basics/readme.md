6. Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly . If a script written in a statically-typed language contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed. Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not. 

Examples of statistically typed languages include C, C++, Java
Examples of dynamically typed languages include Javascript, Python, PHP

7.  Undefined is a data type in JavaScript used when a variable is declared but not assigned with a value. Null is a data type in JavaScript used to assign a non-value to a variable.
